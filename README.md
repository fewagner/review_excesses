Collection of figures for "Challenges of Very-Low-Energy Recoil Detectors".

TBD:

- Fig 1: a-h) schematics of detectors; Figma link: https://www.figma.com/design/SlaJNNhKRNw3Gk0aLarBFy/Detectors?node-id=0-1&t=FEd5BS45lRZxCnXe-1 

- Fig 2: a) energy spectra phonon, b) CCD dark rates over time and thermal limits (can also be b,c,d etc) 

- Fig 3: diagram of different charge contributions (half width) 

- Fig 4: time since cooldown for different experiments (half width) 

- Fig 5: a) schematics of excess origins in detectors (done in Figma), b,c) plots of mitigation through double TES and stress 

- Fig 6: excess fog islands and limits (half width)
